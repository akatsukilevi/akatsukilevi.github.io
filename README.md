## About blogging

The blog section is actually handled by my [DEV.to](https://dev.to/akatsukilevi) profile. All blog posts sent there will be accessible via my portfolio website

## Building

To build, it's simple. Since the project is a simple node.js project, there isn't anything complex to it

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

You can preview it via `npm run preview`.
