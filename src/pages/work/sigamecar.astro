			At around March 2017, there was been a wave of cars being stolen all around the city. It was becoming a frequeny occurence. With
			the prices for car insurances skyrocketing beyond reason, a alternative was needed to ensure cars could be easily monitored and
			secured against theses events.
		</p>
		<p class="text-lg my-2">
			May 2017 came around as the ExpoSec(International Security Fair) came around. Being the main technological showcase in Latin
			America for the security industry, we naturally decided to participate. On the day of the event, we came across a small device,
			a satellite-based GPS tracker. They didn't had a software to use it, only the hardware. We got hands on one unit to test, and
			upon arriving back at the company, I started working with it.
		</p>
		<p class="text-lg my-2">
			Few weeks later, I managed to come up with a small software that could interface with the GPS tracker to monitor a single
			vehicle. This has showed to be quite the perfect timing, because a few days after installing it on one of the company vehicles,
			it ended up being stolen at street. Luckily, due to the vehicle lock functionality, we were able to recover the vehicle in
			minutes.
		</p>
		<p class="text-lg my-2">This quickly sparked that this could be a useful product for customers, to improve their safety.</p>

		<p class="text-lg my-2">
			Few weeks after the stolen car incident, a project for a scalable version of the software started. The goal was to make two
			systems: One that was internal for the company, an management and monitoring software that would keep track of all the vehicles
			and any alarms they might emit, and another one for the clients to keep track of their vehicles and receive real time updates
			about them.
		</p>
		<p class="text-lg my-2">
			It took around a month for the initial prototype, in which the company was founded under the Grupo Ti Solução umbrella. 3 more
			months of development later, and we started using the platform in production.
		</p>
		<p class="text-lg my-2">
			Ever since it was founded, SigaMeCar has been in the market for around 6 years, continuously keeping the safety of vehicles all
			around the country.
