Yeah, ends up my original idea to use Vitepress wasn't exactly the brightest. Don't get me wrong, Vitepress is really good, just not exactly suited for what I was planing to make.

[Astro](https://astro.build) has shown to be way more suitable for the job, so I migrated to it!
Quite funny how it barely took a morning for me to migrate everything to Astro, barely had any hiccups

A huge shout out to [Manuel Ernesto](https://manuelernestog.github.io) for publishing the theme free for everyone to use! Very cool!

I plan on making new posts regularly about how things are going, and what I'm up to! And now using Astro, it will be way easier!
